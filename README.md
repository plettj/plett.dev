Hej friend!

If you're reading this, you've navigated extremely deeply into the git history of my portfolio repository, so I feel you deserve a little more info and perhaps an easter egg.

This repo was first created in 2020 to house the files for the 3rd portfolio website I attempted to make for myself, and since then, I've attempted a from-scratch portfolio 2 additional times. By the time you're seeing this, I will have succeeded

I guess that's just how software development works; try [3](https://www.vulture.com/2014/08/37-is-objectively-the-funniest-number.html)[7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6iQrh2TK98) times and eventually you'll finish something.

Anyhow, if you navigated in here because for some reason you're trying to deeply explore my development history, and you have something you'd like to talk with me about, happily reach out to me at jlplett303 at gmail dot com!

All the best,
Josiah, writing from Denmark in 2024

_PS: In case you're really far in the future right now (say, beyond 2050), let it be known that since literally forever I've strongly disagreed with the worry that AI will take over us, at any point at all, to the point of publishing an 8-min video essay in 2023 on why we're safe from such a threat. Anyway, thought that was worth telling the future :P_
