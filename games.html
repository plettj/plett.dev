						The text that I put here will be introducing how I make my games kind of, and then the next stuff below will be with some images (sweet if I could get them to be triangular) that will have some nice subtitles that aren't really subtitles instead they are just text that's nearby to describe them!

						I've been learning about and practicing game development for six years, and I've created many games, in many genres.<br><br>I also have a fair amount of web development experience, including this site.

						I'm an indie game developer and aspiring software engineer in Victoria, BC. I enjoy front-end development with JavaScript (and HTML + CSS), and I use HTML5 Canvas to make my games. I'm currently in Grade 12, I plan to take software engineering in post-secondary, and I'm looking for any volunteer, co-op, or internship software position.<br><br>My favourite parts of game making are the complex algorithms and level creation.
