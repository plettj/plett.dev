In literary studies, we're often taught to assess a novel by its underlying symbolism, not the quality of its prose or intrigue of its story. George Orwell isn't a good author because he's fun to read, he's good because he writes important metaphors for important problems.

I've always felt this was a disingenuous approach to reading. Why can't I just enjoy the book for what it is, instead of constantly trying to dig deeper into a hidden message? I prefer good characters over good metaphors, but I'm told that's simply wrong.

Yesterday was my first time surfing, and I didn't really know what I was getting myself into. I mean, I'd been told it was a tricky sport, but I imagined if I just watched what other people were doing and played it safe, surely I'd come out unscathed. I was wrong.

#### Paddling out

On the recommendation of a local, I picked up my clunky rental surfboard and started across the sand to the so-called ‚Äúeasy section‚Äù of the shore. Looking out, it didn't seem that bad. A lot of people were on the water already, taking full advantage of the low winds and peaceful waves.

So I started paddling out, and before I knew it, I was ready to try catching a ride. But every time I saw a wave coming, I couldn't turn around fast enough to catch it. I was forced to start looking beyond the nearest wave if I wanted a real shot at riding one.

#### Catching waves

While I was craning my neck to see over the nearby waves if a good one was coming, I failed to realize that the shore was starting to slide away. The winds were slow, but slow is a heck of a lot more than nothing. Unbeknownst to me, I had already been blown right into The Sharks, the professional section.

This meant big waves. Over two meters high, at a high frequency, too. My elementary technique was quickly overwhelmed by such powerful force, and as a wave crashed over me, I was sucked under the water. By the time I could resurface, the next one broke over me, not a moment to breathe. And then another. And another. And another.

#### Surviving

I was in over my head. After some hours of fighting the ocean, and many litres of swallowed seawater, I'd been tumbled nearly back to shore, where I began a whole new fight, this time against a hundred meters of shallow-water barnacles. The waves were still pushing, shoving my surfboard over me and dragging my knees and toes along the barnacles.

With legs dripping red, I eventually arrived at the beach. Lying on the sand, trying to control my breathing, I must've been a real sight, because some surfer dudes with long mullets asked me if I was alright. They were pretty friendly, and they let me know I had just escaped the professional-rated waters. How reassuring.

I picked up my big scratched board and started the slow trek back to the easy section. And as I walked, I got to thinking how on earth this happened. It wasn't just that I was a noob, it was that I failed to recognize the wind's slow, persistent nudge. Had I known how subtle the drift would be, I would've known I should paddle against it.

#### Take Two

After some time to think, I took a deep breath, and started out to the water once again.

Confident the waves here wouldn't kill me, I began to adopt the attitude of a war-torn veteran, looking at the incoming waves with steely eyes. During the calm, I practiced rotating my board quickly, so I would be ready to catch the first one that looked in my direction. It wasn't long before I saw a big enough swell closing in.

I spun myself around, and started paddling frantically towards the shore as the wave caught me. It hit hard, jerking my board forward as I clung on, but the wave gave me no more than a taste of what surfing was before it died, and I was left floating aimlessly, slightly closer to shore.

#### Catching waves, for real

As I paddled back out, I was faced with more great waves coming in after the first, but I couldn't catch them because I'd been pushed too far to the shore by the first one. By the time I made it back to where I was, the waves had passed and the water was flat.

It was nearly five o-clock already, and I was sitting in the flat waters with nothing to show for but gashed legs and salty lungs. If I was going to properly surf today, I needed to figure something out, so I drew on the lessons from my mistakes so far. I started paying attention to the subtle blow of the wind, assessing whether I could handle the waves I was in, and chose to be patient with the waves, letting some good ones pass me by.

The reflection paid off, and soon I was on another wave, thrust toward the shore.

I've never experienced anything like surfing before. It's just you and your surfboard, grabbing the ocean by its reins, teaching it to carry you wherever you please as the crisp summer air rushes by. Yet it's not you that catches the wave, it's the wave that catches you, holding your board so steady you start to wonder, ‚ÄúMaybe I could stand?‚Äù

But then it's over, and the sunset behind you reminds you it's time to head home.

Being taught that deep symbolism was the purpose of creative writing meant I thought myself a bad writer. I didn't see symbols all around me the same way I was told great writers do. In fact, I didn't even look for symbols at all ‚Äî I just took my world in as it came to me, and tried my hardest to make sense of it.

Yesterday that changed. For the first time in my life, I saw my experience as a metaphor.

The journey to mastering the waves is the same journey we all have to live, every day of our lives. The quest to conquer the unforgiving, impossible power of the ocean is the perfect analogy for the twenty-two years I've spent on this wacky little planet.

And I suppose that's it. That's what our teachers were trying to teach us to see, all along.
