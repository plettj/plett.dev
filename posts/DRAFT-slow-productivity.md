[The only reason this blog post is in drafts is because I haven't refactored it to include the idea of battling distraction bullets throughout the essay instead of introducing it just at the end. Additionally, the connection between Productivity and Accomplishment should be more clear, and my rephrasing of Cal's subtitle should also be more clear.]
I like to be a productive person. I feel like every day is a struggle against the risk of falling behind, and if I take my eye off it for just a second, I'll have too much momentum to ever catch back up. So maybe I don't _like_ to be a productive person, but I don't have a choice.

Maybe I developed this view from the relentlessly competitive environment I've found at university, but I think it moreso reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of productivity.

### What is "productivity"?

This Christmas, I was gifted a book called [Slow Productivity](https://calnewport.com/slow/), by Cal Newport. It's a good title, I like it quite a lot. It forces the question of how we actually perceive productivity, and what it means to be productive at all.

As I understand it, productivity is _supposed_ to be a rough measure of accomplishment, over a specified period of time. But if I take the perspective of an objective outsider, I feel like sending twenty emails and doing a whole assignment isn't actually "productive" in comparison to, say, completing an undergraduate degree.

How productivity is viewed in our world today is flat and inconsiderate, not taking into account anything except measurable achievement. Your value as a worker is measured in emails sent, keystrokes hit, tickets completed, or papers reviewed. Your boss thinks of your "productivity" as your day-to-day accomplishment, with little care for the unmeasurable progress you have to make along the way, never mind what you could be achieving over months, if only you were given the time.

## Why "slow"?

From an outsider's eyes, the time it takes to accomplish something will turn out to be a lot less important than the thing itself.

Do you care how long the author took to write your favourite book? Or how many corporate shenanigans it took for Steve Jobs to build Apple into an innovative superpower? Or even the number of decades Martin Luther King Jr. worked before he instigated any major change in American civil rights? No, you don't, as long as you weren't in urgent need of it before it had been accomplished.

This shows us that accomplishment — the more accurate synonym for the flat, modern word "productivity" — should be assessed through a lens that filters out the time the whole thing takes. It makes sense, really. As long as you don't actually think you can accomplish dozens of big things in your lifetime, then you should stay grounded and aware of your biggest goals without getting lost in the ups and downs of mere weeks. If you don't, you risk accomplishing nothing at all.

Yet, this doesn't quite answer the question "why slow?" I hope by now you're starting to connect the dots yourself. If the time shouldn't matter so much, then it becomes far more important to take a few steps back to get a better view than it is to make sure every single step is incrementally forward, at all costs. It's pretty hard to make progress on big goals if you're pressing through a battlefield of little ones the whole time.

### Okay, then what's "slow productivity"?

I would say it's the lost art of accomplishment without burnout. Actually, that's what Cal Newport would say, since it's the subtitle of his book. It's a good summary, but it's not actionable enough for me, so I'd like to make it a little more applicable to our busy daily lives. Forgive the clunky phrasing:

> Slow productivity is the lost art of focussing more on mitigating distractions than increasing accomplishment.

Most of us know how little we can get done when we're trying to do too much at once, and we even know a thing or two about how to not be in that situation in the first place. But we don't _value_ it enough. Each day we still answer those emails and say yes to many little tasks, little bullets flying in to derail our days, then months, then years. Everyone seems to have agreed that bullets are small, so they must be harmless.

\/\/\/\

But the world is wrong. Distractions are bullets, and we better be dodging them like our life depends on it if we want to get across the battlefield, and accomplish something great.
