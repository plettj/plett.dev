- Firstly, realize you should share all your startup ideas. (many other things)
- Maximize flat $$ not founder stake during funding rounds. This is intuitive when you look at probability distributions and what makes or breaks a company. If you think you don't need to maximize $$, then ask yourself why you're raising at all.
- Focus on what's to come, not what's up front! (eg. Hacksaw Ridge not rushing into the story ever, not saying "plz subscribe" at the start of your channel, and not trying to raise capital until you desperately need it)
- Be open. Don't be emotionally invested in any area of the project you're not an expert in. (eg. maxima stage 2 website situation)
