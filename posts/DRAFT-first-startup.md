- Points about startup ideas being important to share!
- Points about why to maximize company value not founder stake!
- Focus on what's to come not what's up front! (eg. Hacksaw Ridge not rushing into the story ever, not saying "plz subscribe" at the start of your channel, and not trying to raise capital until you desperately need it)
