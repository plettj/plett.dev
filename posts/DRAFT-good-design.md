Here is a great post about using clip-path for state-of-the-art web animations. https://emilkowal.ski/ui/the-magic-of-clip-path

Perhaps in this post I can write about the trillion reasons why MUI can look appealing to normal developers but massively hinders design potential.

- Not customizable enough.
- Opaque implementation.
- Version 7 (7!!!) and insane amounts of deprecation on each version.
- Far too many total components.
- Their own examples don't use default styles.
- Unfortunately, very old and wasn't started with the end in mind, so its components are structurally fragmented and imprecisely related (eg. Modal -> Dialog).
