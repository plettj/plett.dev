						I'm an indie game developer and aspiring software engineer in Victoria, BC. I enjoy front-end development with JavaScript (and HTML + CSS), and I use HTML5 Canvas to make my games. I'm currently in Grade 12, I plan to take software engineering in post-secondary, and I'm looking for any volunteer, co-op, or internship software position.
